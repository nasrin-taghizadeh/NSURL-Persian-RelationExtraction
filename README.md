NSURL-2021 task 1: Semantic Relation Extraction in Persian

## Task Definition
Relation extraction is the task of extracting semantic relations between entities in a sentence. We organized a shared task focusing on relation extraction in Persian.

*Sub-Task A: Mono-Lingual Relation Extraction*

Training and test data are in Persian. This task is the same as SemEval-2010 task 8. 

*Sub-Task B: Bi-Lingual English-Persian Relation Extraction*

In this subtask, the training data is a parallel English-Persian data set and test data is in Persian.



## Dataset
In this shared task, training data was PERLEX, which is the translation of SemEval-2010 task 8 into Persian. 
Evaluation set of the shared task consists of 1500 samples.
